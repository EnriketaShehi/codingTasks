1) Periodic Table

The program displays a periodic table of the chemical elements.

The table changes size as the size of the window in which it is displayed varies. The HTML code illustrates the use of flex in building a responsive webpage.

The folder contains three files:
  - periodicTable.html
  - periodicTableSmall.jpg
  - periodicTableStyle.css

To run the program, download the three files in their folder. Right click on the HTML file and select "Open with Google Chrome" (or another browser of your choice). The periodic table will be displayed.
