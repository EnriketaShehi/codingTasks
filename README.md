This repository contains three Coding Tasks completed during the Hyperion Dev Web Fundamentals bootcamp. Here are the instructions for how to use the various programs.

Contents

1) Periodic Table

The program displays a periodic table of the chemical elements.

The table changes size as the size of the window in which it is displayed varies. The HTML code illustrates the use of flex in building a responsive webpage.

The folder contains three files:
  - periodicTable.html
  - periodicTableSmall.jpg
  - periodicTableStyle.css

To run the program, download the three files in their folder. Right click on the HTML file and select "Open with Google Chrome" (or another browser of your choice). The periodic table will be displayed as shown below.

2) Higher Order

The program implements a filter function without using the "filter()" method available in JavaScript. It takes an input array of words of varying lengths, and returns an array of only those words which are six letters long.

The program illustrates the use of higher order functions and callback functions in JavaScript.

The folder contains two files:
  - higherOrder.html
  - higherOrder.js

To run the program, download the two files in their folder. Right click on the HTML file and select "Open with Google Chrome" (or another browser of your choice). In order to see the result of the filter function, you will need to press F12 in Google Chrome. This will open the console where the output array is logged, as shown below.

3) Company Website

The program produces a three page website for an imaginary company, consisting of a Home page, a Products page, and an About page. A navigation bar enables the user to jump between the pages. On the Home page, the user can log in and log out. On the Products page, the user can buy products. On the About page, the company is described.

The program demonstrates how the React library for JavaScript can be used to build a fully functioning website.

In order to see the files contained in the program folder, you should open the folder since there are too many files to list here. Observe in particular though that the "src" folder contains a "components" folder where the code for the various webpages is kept in the relevant component files. The images are kept separately in the "public" folder.

In order to run the program, you will need to install the React library. The explanation of how to do this can be found here:

https://react.dev/learn/installation

In particular, you will need to install the "node_modules" which is a folder containing a very large number of files. Because the folder is so large, I have not uploaded it to this repository (it is standard practice not to include the "node_modules" folder in packages).

Once you have installed React, you can download the "Company Website" folder, add the "node_modules" folder to the "Company Website" folder, and then navigate to the "Company Website" folder in the command line. Type "npm start" in the command line to run the program. The screenshots below show the three webpages displayed by the program.
