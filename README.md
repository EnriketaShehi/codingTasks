Contents

1) Periodic Table

The program displays a periodic table of the chemical elements.

The table changes size as the size of the window in which it is displayed varies. The HTML code illustrates the use of flex in building a responsive webpage.

The folder contains three files:
  - periodicTable.html
  - periodicTableSmall.jpg
  - periodicTableStyle.css

To run the program, download the three files in their folder. Right click on the HTML file and select "Open with Google Chrome" (or another browser of your choice). The periodic table will be displayed as shown below.

2) Higher Order

The program implements a filter function without using the "filter()" method available in JavaScript. It takes an input array of words of varying lengths, and returns an array of only those words which are six letters long.

The program illustrates the use of higher order functions and callback functions in JavaScript.

The folder contains two files:
  - higherOrder.html
  - higherOrder.js

To run the program, download the two files in their folder. Right click on the HTML file and select "Open with Google Chrome" (or another browser of your choice). In order to see the result of the filter function, you will need to press F12 in Google Chrome. This will open the console where the output array is logged, as shown below.
